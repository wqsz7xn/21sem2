- Any kind of system where computation is spread across multiple machines
  - How do we communicate at a lower and a higher level?
  - Example is a client/server model where the server processes a request from
    the client and then the server sends it back
  - Databases can further split the client/server model as the database is often
    stored on its own machine (not on the server
  - These client/server/databases are all communicating at TCP/IP generally
    (lower level) and then there are higher level protocols that you can use
