- Any kind of system where computation is spread across multiple machines
  - How do we communicate at a lower and a higher level?
  - Example is a client/server model where the server processes a request from
    the client and then the server sends it back
  - Databases can further split the client/server model as the database is often
    stored on its own machine (not on the server
  - These client/server/databases are all communicating at TCP/IP generally
    (lower level) and then there are higher level protocols that you can use

** Networking Infrastructure
- Networking infrastructure exhibits the following characteristics
  - Computers and links can fail independently
  - Switches have finite space for storing packets
  - Individual links vary in terms of bandwidth capacity
  - Data can be corrupted during transmission
  - Switches store routing tables that they dynamically update based on
    knowledge of congested links and failed switches

** Network Protocols

- Network protocols are organised into layers
  - Application layer protocols address the needs of particular applications
  - Transport protocols provide for process-to-process communication
  - The network layer provides a packet delivery service between host machines
- Higher-level protocols use the services of the layer directly beneath them
  - A layer depends on the interface of its underlying layer and not its
    implementation (meaning that each layer is completely independent of one
    another, meaning that layers above and below can change)
- Generally IP is pretty unreliable but we build on top of that with TCP which
  has some reliability
- UDP generally provides speed without error checking

** Internet Protocol (IP)

- All of the data is split into packets, these packets are passed into the
  switches which all have routing information to get to the other
  destination. This protocol is unreliable because we don't know if each switch
  has up to date information, we don't know if they are going to fail, we don't
  know if data is going to be corrupted

** Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

- Because of unreliability of IP we need more reliability for more serious uses,
  TCP is a stream abstraction which is an illusion that they are sending data
  directly to the host where the switches are basically just abstracted away
- TCP is a transport protocol that establishes a *virtual connection* between a
  pair of processes: a bi-directional *stream* abstraction that hides several
  network characteristics:
  - *Message sizes / boundaries*: The application simply reason and writes data
    from/to the stream - the TCP layer decides how much data to accumulate in
    the sender before it creates packets and passes them down to the IP layer
  - *Message destinations*: Once a stream has been established, the "connected"
    processes can use the stream without knowledge of pots and IP addresses
  - Lost messages
  - Message duplication and ordering
  - Flow control
  - Ordering of messages (each message is numbered so that you can order them
